# Text-to-Speech
ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech Program:

This TTS program requires an appropriate ElevenLabs API key to work, which can be obtained through any subscription level on ElevenLabs (including the free version).

In order to set up the API key, you will need to set it up as an env variable in the python terminal, which may look like this;

export TALKINGSTICK='your_api_key'

This will only activate the API key for that terminal session, ensuring security.

Work that needs to be done:
- Actually build the rest of the Program (design the alpha)
